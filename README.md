# RTSS'23 Artifact Evaluation

This repostiory contains two different artifacts for reproducing the graphs and results contained in the paper titled:**Co-Located Parallel Scheduling of Threads to Optimize Cache Sharing**.
  

  

The two artifacts that the paper associates with is:  

1. A simulated evaluation, presented in **Section VII**,  of 3-PARM and 3-PARM-HD as comparisons to: 

   1. Exact solutions with co-location EXACTCOLO and without EXACTNOCOLO
   2. Graham's 2-factor makespan approximation
   3. DAG core allocation algorithms without co-location DAG-m and co-location heuristics DAG-LP and DAG-GB. 

2. An empirical experiemnt of a bare-metal Fork-Join scheduling algorithm presented in **Section VIII** of the paper.

# Reproducing the Artifacts

Upon booting the VM a terminal and this PDF should have opened. The terminal should be in the fjcolo directory. A makefile has been provided to reproduce all data associated with the artifacts in this paper. Running the command `make` will reproduce several figures and extract the following figures:

1. `Fig. 6:` Schedulaibity Results
2. `Fig. 7:` Core Comparison for E
3. `Fig. 8:` Core Comparison for X
4. `TABLE II:`  Mean Base B and Incremental Costs Y 
5. `Fig. 9:` Task Analysis and Experimental Results of Group R
   - `(a)` FJ-791 F = .95
   - `(b)` FJ-956 F = .18
   - `(c)` FJ-484 F = .55

![Results succesful](graph.png)
*Expected output after make finishes*  
All reproduced figures and tables will be stored in a `graphs` folder generated by the makefile. 
In addition to this an `artifacts.pdf` compiled of all figures will be placed in the local directory.
